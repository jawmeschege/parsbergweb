				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tate Consulting and Asda Wal-Mart scoop this years Rochdale Borough Sustainable Development Award for their innovative low carbon Distribution Centre. Tate Consulting and Asda Wal-Mart are delighted to have won a Design Award with Rochdale Borough Council for the sustainability achievements of their distribution facility in Rochdale. This prestigious regional annual award places Asda’s Rochdale distribution facility as the number one new build development for sustainability in 2013/14. At an awards ceremony hosted at Rochdale Town Hall, Asda Wal-Mart and Tate Consulting received one of three Design Awards, awarded to projects developed in the region over the last year.</p>
<p>For full details of the story, please see <a href="http://rochdale-council.mynewsdesk.com/pressreleases/simply-stunning-trio-of-grand-designs-scoop-awards-964209">http://rochdale-council.mynewsdesk.com/pressreleases/simply-stunning-trio-of-grand-designs-scoop-awards-964209</a></p>
<p>Tate Consulting have worked with Asda Wal-Mart to design a state of the art distribution facility in Rochdale, along with a suite of other distribution facilities around the country including at Bristol and Grangemouth, which are some of the most sustainable buildings of their kind in the country.</p>
<p>The Rochdale £41m distribution facility comprised a 530,000 sq ft chilled storage centre and 131,000 sq ft recycling facility and was designed to the highest standards in energy efficiency, achieving an energy performance A and A+ ratings for the building and a BREEAM Excellent.</p>
<p>Tate Consulting worked to deliver energy-efficient and sustainable buildings for the site, in addition to a range of additional services including infrastructure, building services and fire engineering.</p>
<p>Sustainability features that contributed to an overall 28.5% reduction in annual energy consumption and 26% reduction in annual CO2 emissions, included a single-skin construction freezer and cold store, low-energy occupancy-controlled LED freezer and external lighting and rainwater harvesting to serve the refrigeration plant and toilets reducing annual water consumption by 30%. The site also benefits from a Combined Heating and Power system producing hot water and electricity.</p>
<p>Tate Consulting has worked with Asda for over a decade, advising the supermarket giant on how to meet its target to reduce carbon emissions by 20% by 2015, as well as delivering core consulting engineering services.</p>
<p>Shane Tate, founder partner of Tate Consulting, said: <strong><em>“These distribution centres are among the world’s most energy efficient buildings, creating a new benchmark for the construction industry and the environment. We are delighted to have been recognised along with Asda by Rochdlae Borough for the sustainability features of the Rochdale facility”.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>“Our core consulting engineering services focus on maximising value and minimising the environmental impact, creating change that will lead to value for our customers. It’s our mission to make new and existing buildings as simple and as energy efficient as possible, taking a strategic approach to design out energy intensive and costly systems”.</em></strong></p>
<p>Andy Walker, Engineering Manager at Asda Logistics Services, said <strong><em>“We are so proud to have achieved such an energy efficient building. Achieving an A and A+ energy performance rating for the Rochdale site is much to the success of the world class team at Tate Consulting. This project sits at the core of Asda’s mission to drive down carbon emissions and sets a precedent for low carbon design in the industry”.</em></strong></p>
